abstract: I am a post doctoral associate at Yale University, Department of Physics. I am working with Dr. Laura Newburgh on the Candian Hydrogen Instensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) project. I earned by Ph.D. from West Virginia University where I built an interferometric array to localize fast radio bursts (FRBs) to submilliarcsecond precision using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). My reseach intersts are ni radio astronomy instrumentaiton and data analysis to help detect faint and ellusive cosmological signals.
